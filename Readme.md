# Lifechoices

A simple piece of accounting software written in Python to let you
predict how much money you might be forcasted to have at different
stages of your life under different spending plans. To being, create
a `transactions.py` file and see `example_transactions.py` as a
template to see how it is made. More documentation to come.
